== Description ==

Shows only posts, that are newer, than the day the current logged in user was created.
This plugin is only useful if you have an other plugin installed forcing any visitor to login first.
In that combination you get a blog in which the posts of older users are invisible for new users.
None of the old users must therefor worry about statements made in older posts becomming available to users he don't want.
In the moment a user publishes a post, the amount of authorized readers for this post stays the same.
